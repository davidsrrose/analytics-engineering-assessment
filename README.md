# David Rose Solution Summary

This section documents my implemented solution. 

The original challenge README is preserved below at [Analytics Engineering Assessment](#analytics-engineering-assessment).

## How to run the project
(from the project root)

1. Use python 3.13

2. Set up and activate the Python environment.

Using `uv`:
```bash
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Or use `requirements.txt` with your preferred Python environment manager.

3. Install dbt dependencies/packages
```bash
dbt deps
```

4. Run the dbt project
```bash
dbt seed && dbt run && dbt test
```
or
```bash
dbt build
```

## Data quality decisions

See the staging model docs for the detailed data quality decisions and assumptions:

- [stg_customers.yml](models/staging/stg_customers.yml)
- [stg_orders.yml](models/staging/stg_orders.yml)
- [stg_products.yml](models/staging/stg_products.yml)

In summary, followed the data cleaning requested in the exercise...
- invalid, future, and too-old order dates are excluded from valid-order reporting
- duplicate `order_id` records are deduplicated by keeping the most recently updated row
- null order amounts are preserved in staging for visibility, but excluded from valid revenue reporting through `is_valid_order`
- duplicate customer emails are retained and flagged for visibility

## Incremental strategy

- `fct_monthly_revenue` is an incremental mart using `delete+insert` at the `country + year_month` grain.
- Incremental runs order `updated_at` dates + the `fct_monthly_revenue` tables's persisted `max_order_updated_at` date to identify which country-month buckets need to be recomputed.
- Once affected (orders in the bucket's scope have been updated since last mart build) bucket, the model fully recomputes the bucket's rows from valid source orders and replaces them.

## Chosen Complex Metric: Option C: Customer Cohort Analysis

- The second mart is [fct_cohort_analysis__first_order_month.sql](models/marts/fct_cohort_analysis__first_order_month.sql).
- It defines customer cohorts by first valid order month, then measures later-month activity for that cohort.
- The mart answers three questions: How large is the cohort? How many customers in the given cohort were active in each observed month? and What share of the original cohort was active in the observed month? (retention)

## Time Tracking
In the spirit of consulting, I decided to track my time while working through the project. Total tracked time was **7.35 hours**.

| Work Step | Time |
| --- | ---: |
| Read repo / instructions in full | 15 min |
| Clone repo, read instructions, write high level ticket list | 10 min |
| Set up python env with uv | 10 min |
| 3.1 Staging - customers | 1h 37m |
| 3.1 Staging - orders | 1h 21m |
| 3.1 Staging - products | 12 min |
| 3.2 Intermediate model | 35 min |
| 3.3 Monthly revenue mart | 1h 23m |
| 3.4 Cohort analysis mart | 1h 08m |
| 3.5 Tests and documentation review | 5 min |
| 4. Deliverables checklist / final verification / PR writeup | 25 min |
| **Total Time Spent** | **7h 21m** |

# Analytics Engineering Assessment

Interview challenge for analytics engineering candidates at Brainforge. This assessment evaluates **data quality handling, incremental modeling, complex SQL metrics, testing, and documentation** using a realistic e‑commerce dataset with intentional quality issues.

---

## Overview

You will build an analytics layer that handles real-world data quality problems:
- **Staging:** Clean and deduplicate ~1,000 orders with bad dates, null amounts, and duplicates
- **Incremental mart:** `fct_monthly_revenue` (country × month grain) with proper merge logic
- **Complex metrics:** Rolling 30-day revenue OR month-over-month growth OR cohort analysis (choose one)
- **Testing:** Data quality tests, relationship tests, custom business rule tests

The task uses **dbt + DuckDB** so everything runs locally.

**Full instructions:** [CHALLENGE.md](CHALLENGE.md) — read this first.

## Time expectation

- **Expected effort:** ~4–6 hours (depending on familiarity with dbt, SQL window functions, and incremental logic).
- We evaluate data quality decisions, incremental strategy, SQL quality, tests, and documentation.

---

## Submission instructions

1. **Fork** this repository (you'll receive access once selected for the challenge).
2. Create a new branch named after yourself (e.g. `feature/jane-doe-solution`).
3. Implement your solution in your branch (staging with data quality, incremental mart, rolling metrics, tests, docs).
4. Submit a **Pull Request** to your fork when finished.
5. In the PR description include:
   - How to run the project (from project root: `DBT_PROFILES_DIR=. dbt seed && dbt run && dbt test`).
   - Your data quality decisions (what you filtered, why, any edge cases).
   - Your incremental strategy and why you chose it.
   - Your choice of complex metric (rolling/MoM/cohort) and the SQL approach.
   - Optional: link to a short Loom (5–10 min) walking through your approach.
6. Share the fork link with the recruiting team.

## Evaluation criteria

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Data quality handling** | Defensive modeling: bad date handling, null amounts, deduplication strategy. Clear rationale documented. |
| **Incremental logic** | Correct use of `is_incremental()`, merge strategy, and performance awareness. |
| **SQL / dbt quality** | Readable SQL, window functions for rolling metrics, CTEs, appropriate use of refs/sources. |
| **Business metrics** | Accurate revenue aggregation; correct rolling/MoM/cohort calculation with proper grain. |
| **Testing & docs** | Data quality tests (uniqueness, relationships, custom tests), business rule tests, clear descriptions. |
| **Completeness** | All deliverables in [CHALLENGE.md](CHALLENGE.md) met; `dbt run` and `dbt test` succeed. |
| **Presentation** | If Loom provided: clarity of walkthrough and design rationale. |
